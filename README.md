Bus Reservation System Project

Overview:
The Bus Reservation System is a comprehensive application designed to manage bus bookings efficiently. The project is developed entirely in Java, leveraging Java Swing for the frontend and MySQL for the backend. Key features include OTP verification for secure login and Razorpay integration for seamless payments.

Frontend:
Java Swing: The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using Java Swing, which provides a robust and flexible way to create desktop applications. The interface is user-friendly, ensuring an intuitive experience for users.

Backend:
MySQL Database: MySQL is used to manage the database, handling all data storage and retrieval operations. It stores user information, booking details, payment records, and other relevant data.

Key Features:
User Authentication:

Sign Up and Login: Users need to sign up to create an account. During the login process, an OTP (One-Time Password) is generated and sent to the user's registered mobile number or email for verification, enhancing security.
OTP Verification: The OTP must be entered correctly to gain access to the system. This adds a layer of security, ensuring that only authenticated users can log in.

Booking System:
Bus Selection: Users can  select their desired route and choose a convenient travel time.
Booking ID: Upon booking, a unique booking ID is generated. This ID is used for tracking and managing the reservation.
Booking Confirmation: A confirmation message is sent to the user, detailing their booking information.

Payment Integration:
Razorpay Payment Gateway: The system integrates Razorpay, a popular payment gateway, allowing users to pay for their bookings securely and conveniently. Various payment methods, including credit/debit cards, UPI, and net banking, are supported.
Payment Confirmation: After the payment is successful, a confirmation is sent to the user, and the booking is finalized.

Booking Management:
Update Bookings: Users can update their bookings if needed. This includes changing travel dates, modifying passenger details, and updating seat selections.

Technical Details:
Architecture: The system follows a client-server architecture. The client-side application (frontend) communicates with the server-side components (backend) to fetch and update data.
Database Design: The MySQL database is designed to handle relational data efficiently. It includes tables for users, bookings, buses, payments, and OTPs.

Benefits:
Enhanced Security: OTP verification and secure payment integration ensure that user data and transactions are protected.
Efficient Management: The system streamlines the booking process, making it efficient for both users and administrators to manage reservations and payments.
Scalability: The architecture and design allow for future enhancements and scaling, accommodating more users and features as needed.
This Bus Reservation System provides a reliable and secure platform for users to book bus tickets, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience.
